# NBAStatsVisualization
Playground for trying to discern cool relationships in NBA stats

### Ideas:

* Player shot chart weighted into how deep into a game/season
* Different combos of (PTS, AST, REB, STL, BLK) vs (Point Differential and wins)
* Clusters of players based on metric (FG%, STL+BLK, etc..)  (Hierarchial to get some sense of tiers of players)
* Shot attempts vs distance through a game and figure out IMPORTANT shots ("Takeover" moments or "heat-check" shots)
* Further extension to use twitter API to find tweets about players heating up
